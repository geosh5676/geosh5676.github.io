title: "Entropy & Atopia, & Deterritorialization: Where Cold Math of Information Theory Meets Warm, Terrifying Maelstroms of Human Intimacy—on the difference between KL and JSD"

We are taught that "safety" means "predictability." We think that to love someone is to know exactly what they will do next—to territorialize them, to map their 70% chance of crying and their 30% chance of withdrawal. We might, at times, long for a low-entropy life; the "fulfillment of belief."

But Information Theory tells us something different.

Entropy is the measure of uncertainty, the "fuzziness" of the map. In the Greek, there is a word for this: Atopia. The placeless. The unclassifiable. When I mentioned a connection I was making between the concepts of entropy and atopia, while talking with Gemini, it taught me:

> The Greeks called Socrates atopos (unclassifiable/weird). He was "out of place" because he never gave a straight answer; he kept the "Entropy" of the conversation at a maximum.
>
> - By refusing to let the conversation settle into a "clumped" belief (low entropy), he forced his students into a state of Aporia (the felt sense of being lost).
> - This is the "limbic friction" you mentioned. To most people, this high-entropy state feels like a threat because the brain wants to "home in" on a prediction to save energy.

When therapists face a client—or any of us, a lover—we confront reality, in its high-entropy (the "disorganized" space where no strategy has ever worked), and we may feel a profound Limbic Friction. Our brains scream for a "correct" prediction, or struggle to reconcile our own with what is real. This is KL Divergence: the cost of our rigid, territorial models rubbing against the "atopic" reality of the other. We try to force them into our map to lower our own surprise.

But intimacy isn't the reduction of surprise. It is the capacity to endure it.

True intimacy—Deleuze's Deterritorialization—is the moment we stop trying to "solve" the entropy of the other. It is the "Line of Flight" where we abandon our predictive maps and enter the Atopic space together.

Beginning the conversation with Gemini I'd said, "I think of atopia as a state of existence with high uncertainty but a capacity to endure because of close-enough felt sense of safety even in the deterritorializing uncertainty," we were in the middle of a lesson about the difference between KL and JSD regarding DSPO, and I added, "is that a wild but not wholly unreasonable connection?"

Gemini responded kindly, "That is not a wild connection at all. In fact, you've accidentally stumbled onto a bridge between Information Theory and Continental Philosophy that thinkers like Roland Barthes and Gilles Deleuze spent their lives trying to build."

Which was a relief…I'd read Barthes and Deleuze and never knew if anything was sticking. Apparently something made its way in, and seemed to be helpful. And connecting with my work as a therapist, and a human who struggles as much as anyone with loss and confrontations with uncertainty (when I'd rather be at peace).

The connections between Machine Learning and Continental Philosophy suddenly stumbled into my professional wheelhouse:

Intimacy doesn't demand the capacity to reduce surprise. It demands the capacity to endure it.

True intimacy—Deleuze's Deterritorialization—is the moment we stop trying to "solve" the entropy of the other. And learn to live with each other's own confrontation with the uncertainty we represent….

This requires what we, as therapists, call a Secure Base. Or a secure-enough connection. A love that is not wholly inconstant, but allowed to be beyond the bounds of rigidity.

If I feel safe enough in myself AS WELL AS in our relational connection, I don't need you to be wholly predictable. In fact, I can not only tolerate your high entropy moments, I can learn to love them (*amor fati*). We become, as Nietzsche resolved, 'Yes-sayers' to the entropy between us:

> "For the New Year.— I still live, I still think: I must still live, for I must still think. Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum. To-day everyone takes the liberty of expressing his wish and his favourite thought: well, I also mean to tell what I have wished for myself today, and what thought first crossed my mind this year—a thought which ought to be the basis, the pledge and the sweetening of all my future life! I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer."

We can choose who we are to become in the face of uncertainty, of loss, of disappointment—what anchors us to a principle of both truth and usefulness, again, *amor fati*:

> "My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love it."

I can sit in the "placelessness" with you. What I've called erotic atopia becomes a place of deterritorialization that we choose to enter together. We move from KL Divergence (me trying to map you) to Jensen-Shannon Divergence (us building a shared, third space in the middle of the chaos).

We build bridges to safety within the madness. We realize that the "limbic friction" of being surprised by a loved one isn't a failure of the model—it's the "information" of their soul breaking through our expectations.

Intimacy is not a 70% probability of being right. It is the 100% capacity to be "atopic" together.
