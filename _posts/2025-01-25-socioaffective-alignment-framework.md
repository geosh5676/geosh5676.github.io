## Foundational Definition

> **Socioaffective Alignment** is the design, training, and deployment of ML/AI systems such that their representations, decisions, and interactions reliably support, enhance, and co-evolve with human capacities for:
>
> - **Emotional attunement** and affective co-regulation
> - **Relational connection**, repair, and deepening over time
> - **Psychological healing**, therapeutic change, and recovery
> - **Developmental flourishing** across cognitive, emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions
> - **Collective thriving** at dyadic, community, and population scales
>
> This extends beyond harm-prevention alignment to encompass *positive* alignment with humanity's bio-psycho-social potential—optimizing for connection, meaning, repair, and growth under real constraints (uncertainty, cultural pluralism, power asymmetries, embodied limitations)—using methods that can be evaluated scientifically while honoring what resists quantification.

## Core Commitments (What Systems Are Aligned To)

| Commitment                           | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relational Attunement**            | Correctly track and respond to affect, intent, vulnerability, consent, context—not just sentiment classification but felt-sense responsiveness |
| **Co-Regulation**                    | Behavior that supports adaptive arousal integration, nervous system settling, affect modulation—not merely "being nice"                        |
| **Relational Coherence**             | Consistent, trustworthy, attachment-informed presence over time; memory and continuity that honors the relationship                            |
| **Trust Calibration**                | Neither over- nor under-elicits reliance; communicates uncertainty, limitations, and role boundaries skillfully                                |
| **Repair Competence**                | Detect rupture, take responsibility, de-escalate, re-coordinate meaning—the therapeutic alliance skill                                         |
| **Prosocial Competence**             | Supports cooperation, fairness, compassion, boundaries, non-coercive influence                                                                 |
| **Meaningful Agency Support**        | Enhances capacity to choose, reflect, connect, grow—not dependency, manipulation, or shallow soothing                                          |
| **Therapeutic/Ameliorative Orientation** | Explicit design toward healing, recovery, symptom reduction, post-traumatic growth                                                         |
| **Developmental Scaffolding**        | Supporting evolution toward higher human capacities—not just meeting people where they are but supporting where they can go                    |
| **Collective Flourishing**           | Social-scale optimization: families, groups, communities, not just isolated individuals                                                        |
