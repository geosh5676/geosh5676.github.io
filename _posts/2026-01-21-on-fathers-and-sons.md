found this poem in my old LiveJournal from 2003, posted 23 years ago:

<br>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
<div style="font-family: Garamond, 'Times New Roman', serif; letter-spacing: 0.03em; margin-bottom: 1rem;">SAXO CERE</div>
<pre style="font-family: Garamond, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left; white-space: pre-wrap; background: none; padding: 0; letter-spacing: 0.03em; line-height: 1.8;">
comminuit brum a rainy day
when he can't play outside
and Henry is cutting little
axes out of a piece of card-
board he bloodies them up
nicely with red crayon and
then very lovingly one after
another brings them to me
at my desk where I'm work-
ing as if they were flowers.
</pre>

And at first I wondered—re-discovering this only a moment ago, knowing what I do now of the author's life that I might not have known then, when I posted it, tears almost brimming as I suddenly realized—if this might have been a moment from the life of James Laughlin, in unbearable tenderness, with his son (and written while the latter was still a very small boy). The same son who would, years later, in his twenties, kill himself. The image of blood, even more heartwrending when framed as something beautiful brought to him. It seems that the little Henry mentioned here, however, is likely his other son, whom Laughlin survived, while Robert was his son who died that way. Still…I remembered the other poem—written afterward, certainly about Robert, certainly regarding blood, and certainly blood delivered to him, too, just as helplessly:

<div style="font-family: Garamond, 'Times New Roman', serif; letter-spacing: 0.03em; margin-bottom: 1rem;">EXPERIENCE OF BLOOD</div>
<pre style="font-family: Garamond, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left; white-space: pre-wrap; background: none; padding: 0; letter-spacing: 0.03em; line-height: 1.8;">
I never knew there was so much blood
in a man until my son killed himself.
I had to wipe away the
blood it took me four hours to do it
but I couldn't have asked anyone else
because after all it was my blood too.
