This is a place for longer thoughts — the kind that don't fit in a conversation, or that need time to unfold.

I'll write here about the intersections that interest me: therapy and technology, attachment and artificial minds, the clinical and the computational. Sometimes about music, or making things, or what it means to be in relationship with others and with ourselves.

For now, this is just a beginning.
